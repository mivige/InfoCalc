# User Guide for InfoCalc

InfoCalc provides a straightforward way to calculate entropy, average length, and efficiency. This guide covers the main functions and usage examples.

## Getting Started

### Launching InfoCalc
1. Open the `.exe` file in the `dist` folder to launch the application.
2. The main window will display a dropdown menu, input fields, and a **Calculate** button.

## Operations

### Entropy Calculation
1. Select **Entropy** from the dropdown.
2. Enter the probabilities as a comma-separated list (e.g., `0.2, 0.3, 0.5`).
3. Click **Calculate** to display the entropy.

### Average Length Calculation
1. Select **Average Length** from the dropdown.
2. Enter lengths and probabilities:
    - Lengths: comma-separated list (e.g., `1, 2, 3`).
    - Probabilities: comma-separated list (e.g., `0.3, 0.4, 0.3`).
3. Click **Calculate** to display the average length.

### Efficiency Calculation
1. Select **Efficiency** from the dropdown.
2. Enter the entropy and average length.
3. Click **Calculate** to display the efficiency.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure all input values are numbers and probabilities sum to 1 where required.
- Refer to **Examples** in the README if youâ€™re unsure of the input format.
